# Recommendation Systems

## Popularity and Likes

This type of paradigm makes a suggestion based on how many
people like the thing.

One prime example of this, is the like button (heart) in Instagram.
When you click that heart, Instagram records it, and based on
information it has on you, it might suggest that to someone else
that is similar to you.

We created the Favourite Bubble Tea service which is based on
the "Popularity/Likes" paradigm of recommendation systems.

## N-Point Rating Systems

N-Point rating systems are used by many services
but one that nearly everyone is familiar with is
Amazon's main purchasing service.

This paradigm is where users rate a product out
of a certain number.
