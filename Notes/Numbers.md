# Numbers

## Integer

In Python they have the type `int`.

Examples:

```
## Floating Point Number

Floating point numbers are positive or negative
numbers with a decimal place in them.

In Python they have the type `float`.

```python
AVOGADROS_NUMBER = 0.0000000000000000000000602
PI = 3.14159
```

If you're ever wondering what type something is, you can
use the `type()` function. It will tell you what type of data
