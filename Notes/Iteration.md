# Iteration

![Loop from Giphy](https://media1.giphy.com/media/6HsjDOBPwY1eIS6kE0/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47u4wu0hvl9m1juhmryx7t9tw7httc7qnwe9k8shyg&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)

We can repeat our instructions using *iteration* or *loops*.

More detailed information can be found [here](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Strings/TraversalandtheforLoopByItem.html). 

# Iterating over a [[List]]

Say, for example, we want to repeat instructions for all items inside of a list. Python has a way that we can do this.

```python
for <item> in <list>:
	<code block>
```

We can use the rules above to iterate over a list, that is, repeat the code block for every `item` in the list.

Think of it this way. We have a list of groceries below. As you can see, Mr. Ubial has his priorities straight.

```python
groceries = ["hot wheels", "ice cream", "video games"]
```

What if you wanted to print out a formatted version of the list, something useful like putting a bullet in front of the item and putting everything on a new line.

We could do something like this:

```python
for item in groceries:
	print(f"* {item}")
	print("---")
```

Which would output this:

```console
* hotwheels
---
* ice cream
---
* video games
---
```

If we imagine that we're looping through every item in the list, the `<item>` name represents that individual item.
## Search - A Practical Example

We can implement a basic type of search algorithm using loops, one is called [linear search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search).

It goes something like this:

```pseudocodeish
for <item> in <list>:
	if <item> == <item you want to find>:
		<do something with the item>
```

Here's a practical example. Let's say that we're looking to see if Jasmine Soto is in the list. We can do this:

```python
names = ['Elizabeth Singleton', 'Raymond Mitchell', 'Steven Murphy', 'Daniel Terry', 'Glenn Fisher', 'Jasmine Soto', 'Deborah Hicks', 'Beverly Ryan', 'Jason Smith', 'Jason Washington']

for name in names:
	if name == "Jasmine Soto":
		print("We found her!")
```
