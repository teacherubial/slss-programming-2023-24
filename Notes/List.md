A list in Python is a collection of items  
We can store *different* values in a list  
**Order matters** in a list

A list is also a [[Type]] of data
# Creating A List
To make a list, we use brackets \[ \] to surround our list  
We separate out the items using `,`

```python
some_list = ["John", "Tim", "Sara"]
```
# Access Elements in a List
We can grab things from lists using the bracket notation  
In our example above, if I wanted to access `"Tim"`, I would do the following:

```python
some_list[1]      # "Tim"
some_list[2]      # "Sara"
some_list[-1]     # "Sara"
some_list[-2]     # "Tim"
```

Inside the brackets, we say the *index* of the value we want  
Python uses *0-index* counting, which means we start counting at 0
