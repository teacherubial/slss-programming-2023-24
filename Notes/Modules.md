Modules are bits of code that we can use in Python  
These bits of code aren't automatically included, so
we need to `import` them into our code

# `import`
The `import` keyword loads the module into our file  
`import`s should be at the **top of the file** under the **header**
# The `time` module
Time allows us to play around with anything related to time  
We can pause our code using `time`

```python
import time

# Pause code for 1.5 second
time.sleep(1.5)
```
