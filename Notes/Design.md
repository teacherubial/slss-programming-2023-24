*The Design Process* is the steps that we take when we create a solution to a problem

There are four steps in our design process
## 1. Design our Algorithm in English (or any human language)
An *algorithm* is a sequence of steps to solve a problem.  
In this class, *before* we start ANY programming, we write our steps in English.
## 2. Translate our Algorithm from English to Python
We'll translate our algorithm into "proper" Python.
## 3. Test our Python Algorithm
Check if it works *syntactically*. In other words, we check to see if it BREAKS.  
Check if it works *semantically*. In other words, we ask does our algorithm actually solve the problem.
## 4. Share our Work
Once it solves the problem, ship your code to whoever will use it.
